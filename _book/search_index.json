Example 1: design a simple spacer Make a new onshape document Make a sketch on the “top/bottom” plane Draw two concentric circles and set their diameters (using the dimension tool) Exit the sketch Extrude the surface between the two circles (set the height) Right click on the new part, then on “Export…”. Download as an STL binary file (resolution = fine, unit millimetrr) Open in Cura Place, multiply,… Set resolution to fine (layer height = 0.06) Prepare and save to a memory stick Start the printer Note that the same result could be achieved through a “revolution” rather than an “extrusion” Example 2: a custom tube holder "],

Be lazy, take advantage of symetries and recurences to avoid repetition Be strategical Test the most critical part of your design as early as possible – refine later Print only small portions of your project to test specific ideas Print several “hypothesis” in parallel "],
